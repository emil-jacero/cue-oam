## Kubernetes-Specific Considerations

### Controller Dependencies
Many composite traits require specific Kubernetes controllers or operators:
- **HorizontalPodAutoscaler**: Metrics server required
- **ServiceMonitor**: Prometheus operator required
- **VolumeSnapshot**: CSI snapshot controller required
- **NetworkPolicy**: Network policy controller required (Calico, Cilium, etc.)
- **Ingress**: Ingress controller required (NGINX, Traefik, etc.)

### Cluster Requirements
Some traits require specific cluster configurations:
- **GPU workloads**: GPU device plugins and drivers
- **Storage**: Appropriate storage classes and CSI drivers
- **Networking**: CNI plugins supporting required features
- **Security**: Pod Security Standards or third-party policy engines

### Version Compatibility
Traits should be designed to support multiple Kubernetes versions:
- API version compatibility matrices
- Feature gate requirements
- Deprecation handling strategies
- Migration paths for API changes
