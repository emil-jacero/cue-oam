2. **Composition Over Configuration**: Prefer combining traits over complex configuration
3. **Sensible Defaults**: Provide production-ready defaults at each level
4. **Clear Boundaries**: Each composite should have a clear, single purpose
5. **Avoid Overlap**: Minimize redundancy between composite traits
6. **Documentation**: Each composite must clearly document what it provides
7. **Migration Path**: Provide clear upgrade paths between complexity levels
